"Luxurious bedrooms, quiet rooms and helpful staff. The hotel actively encourages you to use the room service menus, and the prices are the same as the restaurant so very convenient. Room was clean and silent, and the staff was attentive. Fairly clean. Comfortable bed and linen. Quiet from roadside noise. Bathroom was large and well-appointed, with a rain shower, hand-shower and bath-tub. I had paid for airport pickup and the staff and driver (sudhir) who received me at the airport were very courteous and helpful. Very smooth transfer. Most of the staff i encountered right from those at the hotel gates, were courteous, friendly and helpful. Good location within 10 minutes' drive from the international airport.",2,2,2,2,2

"I stayed for 2 days in novotel as It's resort and spa but very small rooms, can't imagine date rooms without gallery in 5 star resort, poor ac, poor food quality and very less options in breakfast, old furniture in rooms, very big turn off",0,1,1,0,1
The staff at the front desk was rude. Loud sound of exhaust in the room. Work happening in the next room in the afternoon too much noise. Did not expect this from a brand like Novotel. Had a terrible experience while talking to a Mr. Pankaj at the front desk. Staff at the property very snooty.,1,1,0,0,0

I felt my stay quite quaint and carefree. I chose Novotel because I once stayed at Novotel at Batam in Indonesia. Food quality is impressive. Cleanliness is top class. Courtesy displayed by the staff members was remarkable. I wish Novotel had an in-house pub with music and dance floor. Happy days!,2,2,1,1,2
"Rooms need maintenance. My room deluxe had a rusted balcony rod that can break on pressure. Plus mosquito menace in a 5-star hotel. On request, they changed the room. First time I saw that the doorbell has been made defunct for preventing disturbing adjacent rooms. I never had this experience anywhere. Overall good staff, nice breakfast spread, good ambience, at this cost of stay you can opt for other reasonable hotels as no hotel in North Goa is on the beach.",2,0,1,2,2

I was traveling with my wife and 3 year old. We basically extended our stay by booking through MMT however unfortunately the AC went of in the middle of the night. We complained at the main desk and they sent the technician immediately instead of resolving the issue he was arguing with us about some technical error. When complained to Mr. Namit Shetty in the morning he gave us a cold response saying he will look into the matter and would not allocate the room to any guest. We were being asked very rudely to check out saying that you need to check out as It's 12 pm already. Breakfast spread was really great otherwise the overall experience was really good except for what happened.,2,0,1,1,0
Visiting the hotel for the third time. Amazing service and hospitality. Highly recommended for families.,2,2,2,2,2
"Firstly the hotel claims to be a Resort but I found it more like a small hotel, secondly the staff's behavior specially front desk was terrible, namely Mr. Pankaj from the front desk I would like to describe the reason too at night about 12:30 we asked for a cab they kept us waiting more than 1 hour then a cab arrived they were charging extra we agreed as soon as we board the cab after 500 mt the driver dropped us said It's been informed by the hotel to drop wheresoever within 500 mt. When we asked about front desk manager they said he's not available then we asked for their GM again nobody was available. Candolim Beach is quite far as they say within 4 minutes it wasn't Baga Beach about 20 minutes, food was good, the room and the features were fair, but basis of staffs and their terrible behavior I would rate this hotel 1 if you want to have relaxing memorable stay in Goa make sure don't land up in Novotel Candolim",1,1,0,1,0

Service was poor. Never expected that much of poor service in a 5*. 3 or 4 star hotel would provide you a better service. Food was not too good. This property is not near to a beach. And rooms were just OK. Gym is too small. Staff don't even feel to answer you,0,1,0,1,0

Hotel offers much less than what's depicted on the site. The photos make the property look excellent which actually is not. Quality of food and service is very poor and nobody senior was available or chose not to come forward to resolve the issue. The breakfast menu was identical on all 3 days except for minor changes like Sabzi was changed with the Puri or variety of pakora was different and items falling short were taking a lot of time for a replacement. Did not see a single senior person in the dining area at rush hour at breakfast time or come across any Manager level in 3 days stay. Although one of the rooms was upgraded on the second day of stay. Front office not friendly. The pool was very dirty and brought this to notice of lifeguards. Overall an extremely poor experience. Big mistake for staying here for the amount spent.,0,0,0,0,0

We stayed for almost 3 days in this hotel. Be aware that they don't provide room service and if you even make a small dot of stain over the bed sheets they will cost you the price of a new sheet. The rest of the stay was pleasant and friendly reception and cafe.,1,1,1,0,0

Location is right next to the beach the first row is of the Beach facing Cottages and the second row is of standard Cottages. It is a semi- new place built with wooden Cottages. A good place for couple stays but no services are provided. They don't have room service and after 6 pm there is no one at the reception to attend so this converts your stay in a big task. Only one security person is there during the night hours no one to attend the guests. There are near food joints which serve very expensive food and drinking water. They do not have intercom facility and there is nothing as such facilities which they provide. Overall the location and Cottages were the best part rest of the things were having no spicy in the graph.,1,1,2,1,0

He was nervous! he said if i submit the passport as id proof, he needs to click a photo. Never heard that before but i just compiled as all i needed was sleep. They had kept my room key ready. However, the room allocated did not open with the key. So i had to go back, the person gave the second key which didn't work as well. The hotel staff came with a third key and they could not open the room. They wasted 45 minutes at 11:30 pm in the night to open the door. After that, the staff had no clue to check which room are vacant and ready and no authority to give another room. As a guest, i was standing all this while as there was no place to sit in the lobby. Finally, he got 3 keys for 3 different rooms to check which one is clean. Another room was given! the guy was nervous, had no idea what to do in a crisis and no authority to take decisions.

Reception is busy and they take a lot of time to communicate the requirement to the concerned dept. For e. g. My room's tv was not working because the tata sky subscription expired. It took 8 hrs to fix it. The restaurant is expensive and the food is not value for money. The choices are very few and taste is not up to the mark. Again, the service is pathetic.

We kept the kids food along with some drinks in the refrigerator as soon as we checked in around 2:30 pm and it didn't cool even a little till we checked out the next day around noon. They even refused to keep anything in the hotel's kitchen refrigerator.

I informed the staff that it is my honeymoon asked them for a cake to which they accepted very politely and arranged a cake and decorated the bathtub. The swimming pool, the sunset, beach were incredible.",2,0,2,1,2
It's like another home. This place is really exotic. And no one can beat Taj's hospitality and perfection. Thanks to Bhargav and Saurabh for making the stay special.,2,2,2,2,2

"Never imagined that a last minute booking would turn out to be such a memorable and unforgettable experience!! The team at Taj spoils you rotten with so much care and attention that one begins to feel like a top notch celebrity! And no other hospitality chain can ever match up to their service standards! As is the resort itself is a tiny piece of heaven with its clear waters and location but the icing on the cake was the things they did to make our wedding anniversary an outstanding event will remain with us always and forever! From the moment we stepped in to the goodbye, everything was perfect! From curating a special menu, to a surprise cake cutting ceremony on the beach, to filling our jacuzzi with flowers, the perfect candle light setting for our anniversary dinner, everything was just wow! And the turn around between clicking pics of the cake cutting to creating a collage and printing and mounting the pics on a frame, guys did you have a magic wand??? Love you all- Parul, Payal, Diksha, Saurabh, Joydeep, Santosh, Abhishek, Umang, Anil, Mohit, Nadeem and all the F&B team, Kashish and the front desk team, for the awesome memories you put together for us! Thank you and hope to come back when you guys start the sea plane and the dive point! Stay amazing always! Love, Ravi and Ameena.",2,2,2,2,2

I love to stay at the lalit hotel as it is located in prime locality in new delhi; but this time i was a little bit disappointed to find the high standards of the hotel slightly lowered. This was noticed in the quality and cleanliness and appearance of bathroom amenities and towels and napkins and other things provided by the hotel; they were not of the superior quality they once used to be. Also the quality of food in the indian restaurant was mediocre and nothing to write home about.,1,0,2,1,1

Of course, it is a premium service, but we felt it was really worth. The room itself was nicely appointed, but small for two beds. The free WiFi was only for 1 hour per day.

Both dinner and breakfast were good, but nothing was worth rememberable. Service was good and staff was helpful and polite.

And this is very good value for money too. While I travelled on business but this hotel is equally good for family stays as well. The hotel is almost just opposite to the international airport making it very convenient for all those who intend to travel through the international airport. Not very far from domestic airport either, however if your work is in other part of town or closer to domestic airport then you may want to consider other good five star options which may be more convenient and may help you save on travel time.",2,2,2,2,2

Food in breakfast was good with variety of eggs, south indian food, paranthas etc. But the food ordered in in room dining is too much for a person and a bit costly.

"Reached the hotel quite late in the night around 2.30am. The staff at the reception were quite indifferent. Was allocated a room which was quite run down considering Lalit’s stature - misty smell, broken or chipped flooring, peeling paints, electrical fittings ready to fall, dirty or marked furniture. Seemed like the guy at the reception thought he could palm off their worst rooms as I would be least bothered at such a time. Did call up the reception and they did change the room which was definitely befitting Lalit’s stature in away. Did call the duty manager and also informed him of the experience which I went through earlier and WhatsApped the photos as well to him. Most shocking and unfortunately highest standards of professionalism no apologies were either offered by the person at the reception or by Vinay the Duty Manager. Heights of overall unprofessionalism and not expected out of Lalit. Breakfast was at their cafe 24/7. Service here was super and sorry forgot the name of the person who was taking care of me. This guy was efficient, warm and superbly attentive. The spread did look huge and well spread out though it was more because of the accompaniments than the actual mains. The cafe was well Maintained though it overall gave a run down look. Overall not a pleasant experience",0,1,1,0,0

My stay at lalit was amazing. Very clean and well maintained rooms. Nice location near airport. Very helpful staff with warm welcome. Breakfast was awesome. Lalit is highly recommended and one of finest budget hotel in recent time. Pleasant stay. Enjoyed a lot.,2,2,1,2,2
I believe the property is not only about beautiful rooms and locations! it’s more about the service and how you are made to feel! vets mumbai staff knows this best to keep the guests happy and offer the best of customer service right from checking to breakfast to room service to in room dining to checkout! please do keep up the good work of providing the best of service!,1,2,2,2,2
Near to airport n services was all good happy to stay their can also visit with family,2,2,2,2,2
"All staff are very cooperative start from Security Reception and Room service. Salman and Zoheb at Reception, Karan and Jugal at Room service all extraordinarily active and good with tr work. Keep it up",2,2,2,2,2
"A great experience. From the moment I checked in, I knew I was in good hands. They upgraded my room for free which felt great. Post check-in, I observed the staff. They were very friendly and helpful. Everyone was nice, from the reception to the cleaning staff. They were following proper covid protocols as well. The service was awesome. The only problem I faced was there was a slight delay in-room service, but I realized that they were shot on staff due to covid and they had many customers to deal with as it was the weekend. So I didn't mind at all. Despite that, I got everything that I needed. Even ordered food from outside (Swiggy, Zomato) which they allowed, some hotels don't allow that. It was truly a 5 star experience. I hope to visit again.",2,2,2,2,2
"For a 5 star property, the room condition at itc maratha was very poor. Smell of urine and from carpets was very prominent in one room, while the other room had cigarette smell in a non smoking room. After complain the linen of the bed was changed, which raised a doubt that do they change linen after guest checks out or just dust and put the same. Ozonizer machine was used in the other room compromising on health of my kids. Overall not a good experience",1,0,2,0,0
"My room no: was 1207. In this room not working any cellular network. Am staying 4 day in this room. This is worst experience in hotel. To call and had to go in to the lobby. I spoke several times to change the room. Front desk staff told me ""sir will do sir will do"" but 1st day to 5th day morning i faced problems. Nobody changed the room. This was wasting of money and wasting of time for me",1,1,1,1,0
"We had an excellent 2 nights stay at itc, the food and service was amazing. Hygiene was maintained due to covid in dining areas. The plates, cutlery and glasses were well sanitized. 2 issues that hotel can work upon : 1. The hotel was kind of overbooked and there was waiting for all meals at their main restaurant-peshawar pavilion for breakfast and lunch. We had to wait longer to get served. Hotel should open up other options for meals. Even though there was buffet, the chefs and stewards had to serve the dishes and hence this was leading to long queues and wait at the counters. 2. Hotel should have in room entertainment of all the ott platforms, they only have set top box dish tv to watch. Netflix or amazon prime should be available as entertainment since the pool and lawn areas were not operational. Overall complete value for money, the rooms are great and spacious and hotel cleanliness and sanitation is maintained throughout. We would love to visit again",2,2,2,2,2
Location was good. The food was overpriced like 5000+ taxes per pax dinner. The package breakfast was just ordinary. Service was pathetic. Baby food took 3 has to make and that too uncooked. The mood was spoiled at the entry of the hotel when we were asked to wait for 3. 5 has to check in our room as the room was not available. And moreover they gave us a different room other than pool view which was reserved by us. Have never ever been to a locker 5 star hotel in my life. And that to on the occasion of my birthday. Totally spoiled my and family's mood. Most importantly my children's. Will never recommend a Itc hotel to anyone. Disappointing Passage lights in the room was not working and the bathroom light was flickering. Pool room was promised and given back view room. Room check in took us 3 and half hours after literally begging for it. Hotel was oversold. Limited staff on such a event day was the reason for delayed service.,1,1,2,1,0
The hotel was amazing and the rooms and lobbies every area of that hotel was amazing and hygienic. The staff was so humble and helpful.,2,2,2,2,2
Well as we all are aware about Hospitality of Taj. The security was tight but on the other hand the staff was so courteous and soft spoken. From special cooking by chef for dinner to breakfast I enjoyed every moment of my stay. Food was awesome. I got the Gateway I mean sea view room the views of sea and the sound of water was an amazing experience. Must stay if you are in Mumbai. one of the most premium properties of India. wah Taj,2,2,2,2,2
"It is unbeaten when it comes to service and location. The heritage, regal ambiance and home like vibe is fabulous. Sea view rooms have a spectacular view but are a tad smaller. Also, no bathtub as only Taj palace rooms have bathtubs. But despite this tower rooms have better view as It's taller. Food is great as well. Absolutely worth the hype. Best luxury hotel in Mumbai hands down. Also, the staff is kind and isn't snooty unlike most five stars. Hats off.",2,2,2,2,2
"This hotel's hospitality begins to come alive the moment you enter the premises and you are made to feel at home instantly. It is the perfect location from all the famous tourist places, along with high luxurious spacious rooms and suites,paired with creative meeting and business facilities.",1,1,2,1,1
This restaurant is average but the staff is on point. Varun the captain is always attentive and professional. I think the staff makes this bar. I would come back for a this reason alone. Not only is Varun on top his fame but most of the staff is very professional.,1,1,1,1,2

"Maybe it was because of dussehra that the service of the place was extremely poor. We had to call people a number of times for table cleaning, and ordering the food. The food was tasty. That was the only good thing about the place.",2,0,1,1,0
Our most recent visit to this hotel changed our minds! It’s undergone a renovation and is simply lovely now. The staff was courteous and friendly as well. The room was clean and well appointed. Truly a big improvement!,2,2,2,2,2
"This restaurant is located 30-40 meters away from the bus stand. However, it was not easy to locate. They have the jungle theme restaurant offering north and south Indian food. I had Andhra Thali which was served with richness and complete in all respect and not costly too. I liked this place because the place was clean, tasty food , good ambiance and served well by the staff. Would recommend for families whose looking for clean and good food around the bus station.",2,2,1,2,2

"The restaurant has a lunch buffet with north indian food. It's not high quality, but the taste is average. The big surprise came when we had to pay: Rs 480 per person. It felt like a rip off. Perhaps it was since we were western tourists. We've been at other places in Mysore with higher quality food where we paid less than Rs 200. This restaurant was highly overpriced.",1,1,1,0,1

"The blanket provided to our rooms was dirty, the old window type A/C was not working properly, the washrooms were dirty. I had made the booking for 2 people, but the hotel provided for only 2 people. Breakfast was good. But the food provided at the rooftop restaurant was overpriced, and not worth the money.",1,0,1,0,0
"The first and most important fact is that the hotel is in a good location. The hotel was very close to the bus stand, which was convenient. I am happy with staff and the facilities provided for a decent amount.",1,1,2,2,2

"I got bumped up into a suite- so that was great! But, it did not feel much like a suite.  The hotel staff members are very courteous and supportive. The rooms are clean, but needs improvement. Compared to other hotels, the rooms are outdated. The restaurant has a cave and jungle theme, giving a pleasant experience. The complimentary breakfast provided is very limited and mediocre.",1,1,2,1,2

"Hotel is a bit old but location is just perfect. The rooftop restaurant is neat and clean, serving all kinds of food. The price is quite reasonable. However I am not at all satisfied with the room quality. The bathroom is too small and there were insects inside.

I was traveling with my wife and 3 year old. We basically extended our stay by booking through MMT however unfortunately the AC went of in the middle of the night. We complained at the main desk and they sent the technician immediately instead of resolving the issue he was arguing with us about some technical error. When complained to Mr. Namit Shetty in the morning he gave us a cold response saying he will look into the matter and would not allocate the room to any guest. We were being asked very rudely to check out saying that you need to check out as It's 12 pm already.

Hotel offers much less than what's depicted on the site. The photos make the property look excellent which actually is not. Quality of food and service is very poor and nobody senior was available or chose not to come forward to resolve the issue. The breakfast menu was identical on all 3 days except for minor changes like Sabzi was changed with the Puri or variety of pakora was different and items falling short were taking a lot of time for a replacement. Did not see a single senior person in the dining area at rush hour at breakfast time or come across any Manager level in 3 days stay. Although one of the rooms was upgraded on the second day of stay.

Location is right next to the beach the first row is of the Beach facing Cottages and the second row is of standard Cottages. It is a semi- new place built with wooden Cottages. A good place for couple stays but no services are provided. They don't have room service and after 6 pm there is no one at the reception to attend so this converts your stay in a big task.

Water supply to the flush box of washroom was not found. It took more than 8 hours and multiple reminders. Finally we were forced to avail another room washroom. Electrical sockets used are of cheap quality and only free to air TV channels are available. no buffet breakfast or major meal is available. I was forced to opt among three varieties of breakfast options although menu book mentions many more. It takes more than 30 minutes to serve the breakfast.

The guests were also so cultured and disciplined, never saw any guest without mask even in open areas, not a single person having it below nose.

"I had booked a room and advance information was given to the hotel that my check-in would be around 11:30 pm in the night. Was dead tired when i reached. The place was vibrant with no place to sit in the lobby for the hotel guests. The person did not know what and how to scan in the passport. He was nervous! he said if i submit the passport as id proof, he needs to click a photo. Never heard that before but i just compiled as all i needed was sleep. They had kept my room key ready. However, the room allocated did not open with the key. So i had to go back, the person gave the second key which didn't work as well. The hotel staff came with a third key and they could not open the room. They wasted 45 minutes at 11:30 pm in the night to open the door. After that, the staff had no clue to check which room are vacant and ready and no authority to give another room. As a guest, i was standing all this while as there was no place to sit in the lobby. Finally, he got 3 keys for 3 different rooms to check which one is clean. Another room was given! the guy was nervous, had no idea what to do in a crisis and no authority to take decisions.

One star less as the rooms are not at all soundproof/noiseproof. You can hear people talking in adjacent rooms and if there is any loud noise outside hotel, be assured that you would not get sound sleep here.

Reception is busy and they take a lot of time to communicate the requirement to the concerned dept. For e. g. My room's tv was not working because the tata sky subscription expired. It took 8 hrs to fix it. The restaurant is expensive and the food is not value for money. The choices are very few and taste is not up to the mark. Again, the service is pathetic.

We kept the kids food along with some drinks in the refrigerator as soon as we checked in around 2:30 pm and it didn't cool even a little till we checked out the next day around noon. They even refused to keep anything in the hotel's kitchen refrigerator.

From the moment we stepped in to the goodbye, everything was perfect! From curating a special menu, to a surprise cake cutting ceremony on the beach, to filling our jacuzzi with flowers, the perfect candle light setting for our anniversary dinner, everything was just wow!

Thing was breakfast was complimentary and their new year brunch was too high plus tax, so they just shifted the breakfast to a room 1/4th the size and reduced the options from the previous day so more people come to their brunch.

I mean my relatives own a good hotel, i would rate their hotel hospitality 1000% better than this.

I love to stay at the lalit hotel as it is located in prime locality in new delhi; but this time i was a little bit disappointed to find the high standards of the hotel slightly lowered. This was noticed in the quality and cleanliness and appearance of bathroom amenities and towels and napkins and other things provided by the hotel; they were not of the superior quality they once used to be. Also the quality of food in the indian restaurant was mediocre and nothing to write home about.,1,0,2,1,1

Of course, it is a premium service, but we felt it was really worth. The room itself was nicely appointed, but small for two beds. The free WiFi was only for 1 hour per day.

Both dinner and breakfast were good, but nothing was worth rememberable. Service was good and staff was helpful and polite.

And this is very good value for money too. While I travelled on business but this hotel is equally good for family stays as well. The hotel is almost just opposite to the international airport making it very convenient for all those who intend to travel through the international airport. Not very far from domestic airport either, however if your work is in other part of town or closer to domestic airport then you may want to consider other good five star options which may be more convenient and may help you save on travel time.",2,2,2,2,2

Food in breakfast was good with variety of eggs, south indian food, paranthas etc. But the food ordered in in room dining is too much for a person and a bit costly.

"Reached the hotel quite late in the night around 2.30am. The staff at the reception were quite indifferent. Was allocated a room which was quite run down considering Lalit’s stature - misty smell, broken or chipped flooring, peeling paints, electrical fittings ready to fall, dirty or marked furniture. Seemed like the guy at the reception thought he could palm off their worst rooms as I would be least bothered at such a time. Did call up the reception and they did change the room which was definitely befitting Lalit’s stature in away. Did call the duty manager and also informed him of the experience which I went through earlier and WhatsApped the photos as well to him. Most shocking and unfortunately highest standards of professionalism no apologies were either offered by the person at the reception or by Vinay the Duty Manager. Heights of overall unprofessionalism and not expected out of Lalit. Breakfast was at their cafe 24/7. Service here was super and sorry forgot the name of the person who was taking care of me. This guy was efficient, warm and superbly attentive. The spread did look huge and well spread out though it was more because of the accompaniments than the actual mains. The cafe was well Maintained though it overall gave a run down look. Overall not a pleasant experience",0,1,1,0,0

The only problem I faced was there was a slight delay in-room service, but I realized that they were shot on staff due to covid and they had many customers to deal with as it was the weekend. So I didn't mind at all. Despite that, I got everything that I needed. Even ordered food from outside (Swiggy, Zomato) which they allowed, some hotels don't allow that. It was truly a 5 star experience. I hope to visit again.",2,2,2,2,2

I spoke several times to change the room. Front desk staff told me ""sir will do sir will do"" but 1st day to 5th day morning i faced problems. Nobody changed the room. This was wasting of money and wasting of time for me",1,1,1,1,0
"We had an excellent 2 nights stay at itc, the food and service was amazing. Hygiene was maintained due to covid in dining areas. The plates, cutlery and glasses were well sanitized. 2 issues that hotel can work upon : 1. The hotel was kind of overbooked and there was waiting for all meals at their main restaurant-peshawar pavilion for breakfast and lunch. We had to wait longer to get served. Hotel should open up other options for meals. Even though there was buffet, the chefs and stewards had to serve the dishes and hence this was leading to long queues and wait at the counters. 2. Hotel should have in room entertainment of all the ott platforms, they only have set top box dish tv to watch. Netflix or amazon prime should be available as entertainment since the pool and lawn areas were not operational. Overall complete value for money, the rooms are great and spacious and hotel cleanliness and sanitation is maintained throughout. We would love to visit again",2,2,2,2,2
Location was good. The food was overpriced like 5000+ taxes per pax dinner. The package breakfast was just ordinary. Service was pathetic. Baby food took 3 has to make and that too uncooked. The mood was spoiled at the entry of the hotel when we were asked to wait for 3. 5 has to check in our room as the room was not available. And moreover they gave us a different room other than pool view which was reserved by us. Have never ever been to a locker 5 star hotel in my life. And that to on the occasion of my birthday. Totally spoiled my and family's mood. Most importantly my children's. Will never recommend a Itc hotel to anyone. Disappointing Passage lights in the room was not working and the bathroom light was flickering. Pool room was promised and given back view room. Room check in took us 3 and half hours after literally begging for it. Hotel was oversold. Limited staff on such a event day was the reason for delayed service.,1,1,2,1,0
The hotel was amazing and the rooms and lobbies every area of that hotel was amazing and hygienic. The staff was so humble and helpful.,2,2,2,2,2
Well as we all are aware about Hospitality of Taj. The security was tight but on the other hand the staff was so courteous and soft spoken.

Must stay if you are in Mumbai. one of the most premium properties of India. wah Taj,2,2,2,2,2
"It is unbeaten when it comes to service and location. The heritage, regal ambiance and home like vibe is fabulous. Sea view rooms have a spectacular view but are a tad smaller. Also, no bathtub as only Taj palace rooms have bathtubs. But despite this tower rooms have better view as It's taller. Food is great as well. Absolutely worth the hype. Best luxury hotel in Mumbai hands down. Also, the staff is kind and isn't snooty unlike most five stars. Hats off.",2,2,2,2,2

"The restaurant has a lunch buffet with north indian food. It's not high quality, but the taste is average. The big surprise came when we had to pay: Rs 480 per person. It felt like a rip off.

I was traveling with my wife and 3 year old. We basically extended our stay by booking through MMT however unfortunately the AC went of in the middle of the night. We complained at the main desk and they sent the technician immediately instead of resolving the issue he was arguing with us about some technical error. When complained to Mr. Namit Shetty in the morning he gave us a cold response saying he will look into the matter and would not allocate the room to any guest. We were being asked very rudely to check out saying that you need to check out as It's 12 pm already. Breakfast spread was really great otherwise the overall experience was really good except for what happened.,2,0,1,1,0

"Firstly the hotel claims to be a Resort but I found it more like a small hotel, secondly the staff's behavior specially front desk was terrible, namely Mr. Pankaj from the front desk I would like to describe the reason too at night about 12:30 we asked for a cab they kept us waiting more than 1 hour then a cab arrived they were charging extra we agreed as soon as we board the cab after 500 mt the driver dropped us said It's been informed by the hotel to drop wheresoever within 500 mt. When we asked about front desk manager they said he's not available then we asked for their GM again nobody was available. Candolim Beach is quite far as they say within 4 minutes it wasn't Baga Beach about 20 minutes, food was good, the room and the features were fair, but basis of staffs and their terrible behavior I would rate this hotel 1 if you want to have relaxing memorable stay in Goa make sure don't land up in Novotel Candolim",1,1,0,1,0

Hotel offers much less than what's depicted on the site. The photos make the property look excellent which actually is not. Quality of food and service is very poor and nobody senior was available or chose not to come forward to resolve the issue. The breakfast menu was identical on all 3 days except for minor changes like Sabzi was changed with the Puri or variety of pakora was different and items falling short were taking a lot of time for a replacement. Did not see a single senior person in the dining area at rush hour at breakfast time or come across any Manager level in 3 days stay. Although one of the rooms was upgraded on the second day of stay.

"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.",2,2,2,2,2

Basically It's a big house, with separate rooms being sold separately. So if you are a big group of families and can manage to book 4 out of 7 rooms available, then you might enjoy. Otherwise It's just a long photo session.",1,1,1,0,0

Water supply to the flush box of washroom was not found. It took more than 8 hours and multiple reminders. Finally we were forced to avail another room washroom. Electrical sockets used are of cheap quality and only free to air TV channels are available. no buffet breakfast or major meal is available. I was forced to opt among three varieties of breakfast options although menu book mentions many more. It takes more than 30 minutes to serve the breakfast.

He was nervous! he said if i submit the passport as id proof, he needs to click a photo. Never heard that before but i just compiled as all i needed was sleep. They had kept my room key ready. However, the room allocated did not open with the key. So i had to go back, the person gave the second key which didn't work as well. The hotel staff came with a third key and they could not open the room. They wasted 45 minutes at 11:30 pm in the night to open the door. After that, the staff had no clue to check which room are vacant and ready and no authority to give another room. As a guest, i was standing all this while as there was no place to sit in the lobby. Finally, he got 3 keys for 3 different rooms to check which one is clean. Another room was given! the guy was nervous, had no idea what to do in a crisis and no authority to take decisions.

Reception is busy and they take a lot of time to communicate the requirement to the concerned dept. For e. g. My room's tv was not working because the tata sky subscription expired. It took 8 hrs to fix it. The restaurant is expensive and the food is not value for money. The choices are very few and taste is not up to the mark. Again, the service is pathetic.

I visited with my husband in june 2019 and paid for the room for one night. However the room was not up to the standard of a 4 star because there were lizards easily camouflaged in the wooden interiors of the room. The wooden cleaning chemical had a very strong smell that made it feel toxic. At night mosquitoes and insects attracted by light enter the room from window gaps. It was horrible experience.

Rooms were also unhygienic & were in poor condition, bad sheets were dirty, curtains were not there and the bathroom was big disappointment, there were very old design sanitary wear which need immediate replacement plus the only soap and shampoo were there in the name of toiletries. .

Thing was breakfast was complimentary and their new year brunch was too high plus tax, so they just shifted the breakfast to a room 1/4th the size and reduced the options from the previous day so more people come to their brunch.

I mean my relatives own a good hotel, i would rate their hotel hospitality 1000% better than this. A glass or a small bottle of water, someone attending and asking you for tea doesn't cost much to the hotel i guess. Courtesy and care is above luxury. That's my personal opinion.",2,2,2,1,0
I love to stay at the lalit hotel as it is located in prime locality in new delhi; but this time i was a little bit disappointed to find the high standards of the hotel slightly lowered. This was noticed in the quality and cleanliness and appearance of bathroom amenities and towels and napkins and other things provided by the hotel; they were not of the superior quality they once used to be. Also the quality of food in the indian restaurant was mediocre and nothing to write home about.,1,0,2,1,1

The food was excellent, the breakfast buffet had a wide variety of quality food. We had arranged for a pick up from the airport and the hotel representative met us at the baggage carousel itself. Of course, it is a premium service, but we felt it was really worth. The room itself was nicely appointed, but small for two beds. The free WiFi was only for 1 hour per day. I thought these two were a bit below our expectation. Overall, my family and I enjoyed the stay in The Lalit.",2,2,2,2,2
"This is a good hotel at great business location. We got rooms on the twenty first floor which presented a nice view of Delhi city. We requested for connected rooms but could not get it though we placed the request a day back. With a delay of 45 minutes we got on same floor with two rooms apart. Both dinner and breakfast were good, but nothing was worth rememberable. Service was good and staff was helpful and polite. Comparing to other 5-Star properties the rooms are on a bit costly, side specifically considering the size of bathrooms, quality of accessories, quality of bed, etc.",1,2,2,1,2

There are sanitizers placement at all possible common areas right from the restaurant entrance, multiple spots in the restaurant, washrooms, and elevators section on all floors. There is a slot system allotted for breakfast across 4 different time slots for all guests, limiting the number of people having breakfast and limiting the crowding. All the guests must sanitize and use disposable gloves before they head to the food section. The tables allotted to the guests are sanitized before they are allowed to the next guest.

While all is perfect and excellent about this hotel, it is the politeness and promptness of the staff that stands out. All are very eager to help at all times. And this is very good value for money too. While I travelled on business but this hotel is equally good for family stays as well. The hotel is almost just opposite to the international airport making it very convenient for all those who intend to travel through the international airport. Not very far from domestic airport either, however if your work is in other part of town or closer to domestic airport then you may want to consider other good five star options which may be more convenient and may help you save on travel time.",2,2,2,2,2
"Property location is good as it is just 1 km from the airport. Food in breakfast was good with variety of eggs, south indian food, paranthas etc. But the food ordered in in room dining is too much for a person and a bit costly. Like a biryani is sufficient for 3 person so it may lead to good wastage. Hygiene standards were followed and safety protocols were followed.",1,2,2,2,2
"Reached the hotel quite late in the night around 2.30am. The staff at the reception were quite indifferent. Was allocated a room which was quite run down considering Lalit’s stature - misty smell, broken or chipped flooring, peeling paints, electrical fittings ready to fall, dirty or marked furniture. Seemed like the guy at the reception thought he could palm off their worst rooms as I would be least bothered at such a time. Did call up the reception and they did change the room which was definitely befitting Lalit’s stature in away. Did call the duty manager and also informed him of the experience which I went through earlier and WhatsApped the photos as well to him. Most shocking and unfortunately highest standards of professionalism no apologies were either offered by the person at the reception or by Vinay the Duty Manager. Heights of overall unprofessionalism and not expected out of Lalit. Breakfast was at their cafe 24/7. Service here was super and sorry forgot the name of the person who was taking care of me. This guy was efficient, warm and superbly attentive. The spread did look huge and well spread out though it was more because of the accompaniments than the actual mains. The cafe was well Maintained though it overall gave a run down look. Overall not a pleasant experience",0,1,1,0,0

They were very friendly and helpful. Everyone was nice, from the reception to the cleaning staff. They were following proper covid protocols as well. The service was awesome. The only problem I faced was there was a slight delay in-room service, but I realized that they were shot on staff due to covid and they had many customers to deal with as it was the weekend. So I didn't mind at all. Despite that, I got everything that I needed. Even ordered food from outside (Swiggy, Zomato) which they allowed, some hotels don't allow that. It was truly a 5 star experience. I hope to visit again.",2,2,2,2,2
"For a 5 star property, the room condition at itc maratha was very poor. Smell of urine and from carpets was very prominent in one room, while the other room had cigarette smell in a non smoking room. After complain the linen of the bed was changed, which raised a doubt that do they change linen after guest checks out or just dust and put the same. Ozonizer machine was used in the other room compromising on health of my kids. Overall not a good experience",1,0,2,0,0
"My room no: was 1207. In this room not working any cellular network. Am staying 4 day in this room. This is worst experience in hotel. To call and had to go in to the lobby.

This was wasting of money and wasting of time for me",1,1,1,1,0
"We had an excellent 2 nights stay at itc, the food and service was amazing. Hygiene was maintained due to covid in dining areas. The plates, cutlery and glasses were well sanitized. 2 issues that hotel can work upon : 1. The hotel was kind of overbooked and there was waiting for all meals at their main restaurant-peshawar pavilion for breakfast and lunch. We had to wait longer to get served. Hotel should open up other options for meals. Even though there was buffet, the chefs and stewards had to serve the dishes and hence this was leading to long queues and wait at the counters. 2. Hotel should have in room entertainment of all the ott platforms, they only have set top box dish tv to watch. Netflix or amazon prime should be available as entertainment since the pool and lawn areas were not operational. Overall complete value for money, the rooms are great and spacious and hotel cleanliness and sanitation is maintained throughout. We would love to visit again",2,2,2,2,2
Location was good. The food was overpriced like 5000+ taxes per pax dinner. The package breakfast was just ordinary. Service was pathetic. Baby food took 3 has to make and that too uncooked. The mood was spoiled at the entry of the hotel when we were asked to wait for 3. 5 has to check in our room as the room was not available. And moreover they gave us a different room other than pool view which was reserved by us. Have never ever been to a locker 5 star hotel in my life. And that to on the occasion of my birthday. Totally spoiled my and family's mood. Most importantly my children's. Will never recommend a Itc hotel to anyone. Disappointing Passage lights in the room was not working and the bathroom light was flickering. Pool room was promised and given back view room. Room check in took us 3 and half hours after literally begging for it. Hotel was oversold. Limited staff on such a event day was the reason for delayed service.,1,1,2,1,0

Also, no bathtub as only Taj palace rooms have bathtubs. But despite this tower rooms have better view as It's taller. Food is great as well. Absolutely worth the hype.

First time I saw that the doorbell has been made defunct for preventing disturbing adjacent rooms. I never had this experience anywhere. Overall good staff, nice breakfast spread, good ambience, at this cost of stay you can opt for other reasonable hotels as no hotel in North Goa is on the beach.",2,0,1,2,2
