"Luxurious bedrooms, quiet rooms and helpful staff. The hotel actively encourages you to use the room service menus, and the prices are the same as the restaurant so very convenient. Room was clean and silent, and the staff was attentive. Fairly clean. Comfortable bed and linen. Quiet from roadside noise. Bathroom was large and well-appointed, with a rain shower, hand-shower and bath-tub. I had paid for airport pickup and the staff and driver (sudhir) who received me at the airport were very courteous and helpful. Very smooth transfer. Most of the staff i encountered right from those at the hotel gates, were courteous, friendly and helpful. Good location within 10 minutes' drive from the international airport.",2,2,2,2,2

The staff at the front desk was rude. Loud sound of exhaust in the room. Work happening in the next room in the afternoon too much noise. Did not expect this from a brand like Novotel. Had a terrible experience while talking to a Mr. Pankaj at the front desk. Staff at the property very snooty.,1,1,0,0,0

I felt my stay quite quaint and carefree. I chose Novotel because I once stayed at Novotel at Batam in Indonesia. Food quality is impressive. Cleanliness is top class. Courtesy displayed by the staff members was remarkable. I wish Novotel had an in-house pub with music and dance floor. Happy days!,2,2,1,1,2
"Rooms need maintenance. My room deluxe had a rusted balcony rod that can break on pressure. Plus mosquito menace in a 5-star hotel. On request, they changed the room. First time I saw that the doorbell has been made defunct for preventing disturbing adjacent rooms. I never had this experience anywhere. Overall good staff, nice breakfast spread, good ambience, at this cost of stay you can opt for other reasonable hotels as no hotel in North Goa is on the beach.",2,0,1,2,2

I was traveling with my wife and 3 year old. We basically extended our stay by booking through MMT however unfortunately the AC went of in the middle of the night. We complained at the main desk and they sent the technician immediately instead of resolving the issue he was arguing with us about some technical error. When complained to Mr. Namit Shetty in the morning he gave us a cold response saying he will look into the matter and would not allocate the room to any guest. We were being asked very rudely to check out saying that you need to check out as it's 12 pm already. Breakfast spread was really great otherwise the overall experience was really good except for what happened.,2,0,1,1,0
Visiting the hotel for the third time. Amazing service and hospitality. Highly recommended for families.,2,2,2,2,2
"Firstly the hotel claims to be a Resort but I found it more like a small hotel, secondly the staff's behavior specially front desk was terrible, namely Mr. Pankaj from the front desk I would like to describe the reason too at night about 12:30 we asked for a cab they kept us waiting more than 1 hour then a cab arrived they were charging extra we agreed as soon as we board the cab after 500 mt the driver dropped us said it's been informed by the hotel to drop where soever within 500mt. When we asked about front desk manager they said he's not available then we asked for their GM again nobody was available. Candolim Beach is quite far as they say within 4 minutes it wasn't Baga Beach about 20 minutes, food was good, the room and the features were fair, but basis of staffs and their terrible behavior I would rate this hotel 1 if you want to have relaxing memorable stay in Goa make sure don't land up in Novotel Candolim",1,1,0,1,0

Service was poor. Never expected that much of poor service in a 5*. 3 or 4 star hotel would provide you a better service. Food was not too good. This property is not near to a beach. And rooms were just OK. Gym is too small. Staff don't even feel to answer you,0,1,0,1,0

Hotel offers much less than what's depicted on the site. The photos make the property look excellent which actually is not. Quality of food and service is very poor and nobody senior was available or chose not to come forward to resolve the issue. The breakfast menu was identical on all 3 days except for minor changes like Sabzi was changed with the Puri or variety of pakora was different and items falling short were taking a lot of time for a replacement. Did not see a single senior person in the dining area at rush hour at breakfast time or come across any Manager level in 3 days stay. Although one of the rooms was upgraded on the second day of stay. Front office not friendly. The pool was very dirty and brought this to notice of lifeguards. Overall an extremely poor experience. Big mistake for staying here for the amount spent.,0,0,0,0,0
